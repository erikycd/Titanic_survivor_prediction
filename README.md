## A Machine Learning-based guide to predict the survival rate of the Titanic disaster

From the classic Titanic machine learning (ML) competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) website. The very first steps to dive into ML competitions and familiarize with prediction systems.

The approach shown here makes use of classic ML techniques to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. 

Basically, the process involves:

    * Feature engineering
      * Data analysis
      * Age prediction
      * Fares estimation
    * Data cleaning
    * Data normalization and scaling
    * Automatic classification
